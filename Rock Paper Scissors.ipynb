    "## Introduction\n",
    "- The Rock Paper Scissors is a simple game that generates three constant values i.e., Rock, Paper, Scissors., Randomly using Random function.\n",
    "- The Random Library has a random function that generates output value randomly.\n",
    "- In this Game, we will Elevate the normal game by playing this game with computer or with 'SIX' other players, whose options , ironically, are generated by the computer itself.\n",
    "- As a future scope we can take input from users.\n",
    "- If the input is invalid or there is no clear winner, appropriate messages are displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Use Cases:\n",
    "- While playing against computer, the computer's response will be generated using random function and the player chooses its own response by will.\n",
    "- While playing amongst multiple players their responses are generated using random function for each player enumerating."
